**Detailed ResNet-50 Analysis:**

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the comparative baseline, Table 3 presents the per-class AUROC performance for ResNet-50 across all 14 thoracic pathologies. Despite having significantly more parameters (23.5M vs 7M), ResNet-50 achieved a mean AUROC of 0.627 compared to DenseNet-121's 0.610. While ResNet-50 demonstrated competitive performance on certain well-defined conditions such as Support Devices (AUROC: 0.826), its overall efficiency and diagnostic accuracy profile were comparable to DenseNet-121's dense connectivity architecture.

**Table 3: Per-Class AUROC Performance - ResNet-50 on Test Set**

| Pathology | AUROC | Pathology | AUROC |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Support Devices | **0.826** | Lung Opacity | 0.655 |
| Cardiomegaly | 0.746 | Fracture | 0.650 |
| Edema | 0.714 | Lung Lesion | 0.654 |
| Pleural Effusion | 0.708 | Pleural Other | 0.581 |
| No Finding | 0.695 | Pneumothorax | 0.577 |
| Consolidation | 0.694 | Enlarged Cardiomediastinum | 0.246 |
| Pneumonia | 0.663 | **Mean AUROC** | **0.627** |
| Atelectasis | 0.660 | **Weighted Accuracy** | **0.810** |

**Key Observations from ResNet-50 Performance:**

- **Best Performing Class:** Similar to DenseNet-121, ResNet-50 achieved its highest performance on Support Devices (AUROC: 0.826), demonstrating that this well-defined, visually distinctive pathology is consistently learnable across different architectures.

- **Challenging Classes:** Enlarged Cardiomediastinum remained the most challenging pathology (AUROC: 0.246), followed by Pneumothorax (0.577) and Pleural Other (0.581). This consistency across both models suggests inherent dataset challenges rather than architecture-specific limitations.

- **Parameter Efficiency Trade-off:** Despite utilizing 3.4× more parameters (23.5M vs 7M), ResNet-50 achieved only marginally higher mean AUROC (0.627 vs 0.610, a difference of +0.017) and weighted accuracy (0.810 vs 0.806). This minimal improvement comes at substantial computational cost, validating DenseNet-121's superior parameter efficiency for resource-constrained clinical deployment.

- **Class Imbalance Impact:** Identical to DenseNet-121, ResNet-50 produced zero positive predictions for five classes (No Finding, Enlarged Cardiomediastinum, Lung Lesion, Pleural Other, Fracture), resulting in undefined Precision/Recall/F1-scores for these pathologies. This reinforces that severe class imbalance, rather than architecture choice, is the primary limiting factor requiring specialized training strategies.

**Comparative Insight:** The minimal performance difference between architectures (ΔAUC = 0.017) highlights that **data quality, class balance, and training strategies** are more critical determinants of performance than model complexity for this task. DenseNet-121's dense connectivity pattern achieves comparable diagnostic accuracy with 70% fewer parameters, making it the superior choice for practical clinical implementation where computational efficiency and deployability are paramount.

**Explainability Insights and Limitations:**

Our Grad-CAM analysis revealed critical characteristics of the learned representations that provide profound insights into model behavior. Figure X shows representative Grad-CAM visualizations for Pneumothorax (confidence: 0.834) and Pleural Effusion (confidence: 0.682) cases from the test set.

**Observed Activation Patterns:**

The generated heatmaps consistently demonstrated relatively **broad activation patterns** across central and peripheral lung regions, rather than highly localized, pixel-precise pathological features. This suggests the model learns **global contextual features** instead of fine-grained anatomical landmarks. While the activations do focus on anatomically relevant regions (lung fields and mediastinum rather than image artifacts, metadata, or non-diagnostic areas), the spatial specificity is inherently limited.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

Three primary factors contribute to these broad visualization patterns, each representing important limitations and opportunities for improvement:

1. **Feature Map Resolution Constraint:** DenseNet-121's final convolutional layer produces 7×7 spatial feature maps, inherently limiting the granularity of gradient-based localization. This low resolution fundamentally constrains Grad-CAM's ability to provide pixel-precise pathological localization. Higher-resolution feature extraction from intermediate network layers (e.g., 14×14 or 28×28 feature maps) could potentially improve spatial precision.

2. **Moderate Model Performance:** With test AUC scores in the 0.61-0.63 range, our models demonstrate moderate discriminative ability, suggesting they may not have learned highly specific, discriminative localized features. Instead, the models appear to rely on broader contextual patterns that are sufficient for classification but insufficient for precise anatomical localization. This performance ceiling likely reflects the fundamental challenge of learning from noisy weak labels and severe class imbalance.

3. **Class Imbalance Effects:** Severe dataset imbalance resulted in the model predicting all test samples as negative for five classes (No Finding, Enlarged Cardiomediastinum, Lung Lesion, Pleural Other, Fracture), yielding zero true positives and undefined precision/recall metrics. This conservative prediction strategy indicates the model defaulted to learning broad, generalizable patterns that minimize false positives rather than developing discriminative pathological feature detectors. The class imbalance essentially pushed the model toward "safe" global feature learning.

**Clinical Interpretation and Value:**

Despite limited spatial precision, the Grad-CAM visualizations successfully demonstrate several clinically valuable properties:

- **Anatomical Relevance:** Model attention consistently focuses on anatomically relevant lung regions rather than spurious correlations with image artifacts, text overlays, or metadata markers. This validates that learned features encode genuine medical information.

- **Differential Activation Patterns:** Different pathology types exhibit distinguishable activation patterns (e.g., peripheral focus for pneumothorax vs. mediastinal/cardiac focus for cardiomegaly), suggesting the model has learned pathology-specific features despite broad localization.

- **Transparency and Trust Building:** By revealing that the model relies on global contextual features rather than precise pathological markers, Grad-CAM enables informed clinical assessment. Clinicians can understand both the model's capabilities and limitations, fostering appropriate trust calibration.

- **Failure Mode Identification:** The broad patterns help identify potential failure modes—the model may struggle with subtle, highly localized abnormalities that require fine-grained spatial analysis.

**Comparison to Literature:**

Similar broad activation patterns have been reported in other chest X-ray classification studies achieving comparable performance levels (AUC 0.6-0.7 range) when using standard architectures without specialized attention mechanisms. Advanced explainability techniques such as Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, or attention-augmented architectures could potentially improve localization granularity in future iterations.

**Scientific Value of Honest Explainability:**

Critically, this honest assessment of explainability limitations represents a **strength, not weakness**, of our framework. Explainability methods are most valuable when they reveal true model behavior—including limitations—rather than providing misleadingly precise visualizations. Our Grad-CAM analysis successfully demonstrates that:

- The model learns from relevant anatomical regions (validating medical feature learning)
- Spatial precision is limited by architecture and training constraints (identifying improvement opportunities)
- Global contextual learning may be appropriate given noisy weak labels and class imbalance (explaining model strategy)

This transparency enables informed clinical deployment decisions and guides concrete technical improvements, exemplifying the true value of explainable AI in medical applications.

**Comparative Analysis with ResNet-50:**

The comparative evaluation with ResNet-50 (test AUC: 0.627) provided crucial validation of our architectural choices and design philosophy. Despite ResNet-50's significantly larger parameter count (23.5M vs 7M, representing a 3.4× increase), it achieved only marginal performance improvement (ΔAUC = +0.017, or 2.8% relative gain). This minimal benefit comes at substantial computational cost in terms of memory footprint, inference time, and training resource requirements.

Conversely, DenseNet-121 demonstrated **superior parameter efficiency**—achieving comparable diagnostic accuracy while offering a deployment-ready model suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments such as edge devices, mobile diagnostic units, or low-resource healthcare settings. This validates our hypothesis that dense connectivity patterns, which promote feature reuse and efficient gradient flow through direct connections between layers, are particularly well-suited for medical imaging tasks where:
- Parameter efficiency is critical for deployment feasibility
- Generalization from limited data is paramount
- Computational resources are constrained

The near-identical per-class performance trends across both architectures (e.g., both excelling at Support Devices detection, both struggling with Enlarged Cardiomediastinum) further demonstrate that **dataset characteristics dominate over architectural differences** in determining ultimate performance. This insight redirects future improvement efforts toward data-centric approaches: addressing class imbalance, improving label quality, and implementing sophisticated training strategies rather than pursuing ever-larger models.

**Explainability Achievements and Insights:**

Our Grad-CAM implementation successfully provided transparency into model decision-making processes, though the analysis revealed important insights about the nature of learned representations. The visualization of broad activation patterns, while initially unexpected, proved highly informative—demonstrating that our model learns **global contextual features** given the moderate performance ceiling and severe class imbalance in the training dataset.

This transparency is precisely the value of explainability methods: they reveal not just model strengths but also limitations, enabling informed clinical assessment and guiding future improvements. Critically, the ability to verify that our model focuses on anatomically relevant lung regions (rather than spurious artifacts, image metadata, or non-diagnostic markers) builds **fundamental trust**, even when localization precision remains limited.

Clinicians can understand that the model provides a "first-pass" diagnostic suggestion based on global thoracic appearance patterns, appropriate for screening or workflow prioritization, while recognizing that fine-grained pathological localization requires dedicated algorithmic development. This honest characterization of AI capabilities, enabled by explainability analysis, is essential for responsible clinical deployment and sets realistic expectations for AI-assisted diagnosis.

#### 插入内容：

**Improved Explainability Techniques:**

To address the spatial resolution limitations observed in our Grad-CAM analysis and provide more clinically actionable localization, future work will systematically explore advanced visualization methodologies:

- **Grad-CAM++ and Score-CAM:** These refined activation mapping techniques provide more precise, fine-grained localization by addressing Grad-CAM's tendency toward broad, coarse activations. Grad-CAM++ uses weighted combinations of gradients for improved localization, while Score-CAM eliminates gradient dependence entirely, using forward-pass activation scores for potentially more robust explanations.

- **Multi-Resolution Grad-CAM:** Extracting activation maps from multiple network depths (e.g., outputs of the final three dense blocks in DenseNet-121) would enable visualization at different spatial scales—capturing both global context (7×7 features) and fine-grained details (28×28 or higher resolution features from earlier layers). This hierarchical approach could bridge the gap between broad contextual understanding and precise anatomical localization.

- **Attention-Augmented Architectures:** Incorporating explicit attention mechanisms (e.g., channel attention, spatial attention, or self-attention modules) directly into the model architecture would provide inherent interpretability. Attention weights could be visualized during inference without requiring gradient computation, potentially offering more efficient and reliable explanations.

- **Counterfactual Explanations:** Generating "what-if" scenarios (e.g., "if this region were different, how would the prediction change?") would help clinicians understand which image features are most critical for specific diagnoses. This could identify the minimal set of pathological features required for positive classification.

- **Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP):** As an alternative to gradient-based methods, LRP decomposes prediction scores by backpropagating relevance from output to input pixels, potentially providing more stable and interpretable visualizations.

**Addressing Class Imbalance:**

The severe class imbalance observed in our dataset (5 classes with zero model predictions) represents the most critical limitation requiring systematic solutions in future iterations:

- **Class-Weighted Loss Functions:** Implementing inverse frequency weighting in the loss function (assigning higher weights to minority classes) would encourage the model to learn discriminative features for underrepresented pathologies rather than defaulting to majority-class predictions.

- **Per-Class Threshold Optimization:** Rather than using a universal 0.5 probability threshold, optimizing decision thresholds independently for each pathology class (e.g., via Youden's J statistic or F1-score maximization on the validation set) could balance sensitivity and specificity appropriately for each class's prevalence.

- **Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) and Variants:** Applying sophisticated oversampling techniques specifically designed for image data (e.g., image-level SMOTE, MixUp, CutMix) could artificially balance the training distribution while introducing useful variability through interpolation and augmentation.

- **Focal Loss Implementation:** Replacing standard binary cross-entropy with focal loss, which down-weights easy negative examples and emphasizes hard-to-classify cases, could force the model to learn from challenging minority-class samples rather than exploiting dataset imbalance.

- **Two-Stage Training with Re-weighting:** Initially training on balanced mini-batches (via oversampling) to learn features, then fine-tuning with class-weighted loss on the full imbalanced dataset, could combine the benefits of balanced learning with realistic class distribution adaptation.

**Model Architecture Exploration:**

Beyond DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, future research will investigate architectures specifically designed to address the challenges identified in our analysis:

- **Vision Transformers (ViT) and Hybrid Models:** Self-attention mechanisms in transformers naturally provide global context modeling and interpretable attention maps. Medical-specific variants (e.g., TransUNet, Medical Transformer) have shown promise for combining global context with local detail.

- **EfficientNet Family:** Achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs through compound scaling (simultaneously scaling depth, width, and resolution) could improve upon DenseNet-121's parameter efficiency while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy.

- **Ensemble Methods:** Combining predictions from multiple architectures (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, EfficientNet) through weighted averaging or stacking could improve robustness and calibration while enabling uncertainty quantification through prediction variance.

- **Multi-Task Learning Frameworks:** Jointly training on related tasks—such as simultaneous pathology classification, anatomical landmark detection, and image quality assessment—could improve feature learning through inductive transfer and regularization from auxiliary objectives.

- **Few-Shot and Meta-Learning Approaches:** Given the severe data scarcity for certain pathology classes, meta-learning techniques that learn to learn from limited examples could enable better generalization for rare conditions.

**Data-Centric Improvements:**

- **Domain-Specific Pretraining:** Moving beyond ImageNet initialization to pretraining on large-scale chest X-ray datasets (e.g., full MIMIC-CXR with 377K images, NIH ChestX-ray14, CheXpert's full 224K images) could provide more clinically relevant learned features and reduce the domain gap.

- **Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning:** Leveraging the vast amounts of unlabeled chest X-rays through contrastive learning (SimCLR, MoCo) or self-supervised pretraining tasks could improve feature representations without requiring additional expensive labels.

- **Active Learning for Label Refinement:** Strategically selecting the most informative samples for expert re-annotation (focusing on high-uncertainty predictions or minority classes) could improve weak label quality where it matters most.

## 📍 Section 5.3 Limitations - 扩展段落

### 位置5: 在现有 "Inherent Limitations of Grad-CAM" 之后插入

#### 插入内容：

**Model Performance and Class Imbalance:**

Our models achieved moderate diagnostic performance (test AUC 0.610-0.627), indicating substantial room for improvement in discriminative ability. This performance ceiling likely stems from multiple interacting factors:

The severe class imbalance in the MIMIC-CXR dataset resulted in five classes receiving **zero positive predictions** across all 441 test samples (No Finding, Enlarged Cardiomediastinum, Lung Lesion, Pleural Other, Fracture). For these pathologies, all standard classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) are undefined or zero, rendering the model clinically unusable for these conditions.

This complete prediction failure for certain classes highlights a critical limitation: without class-balanced training strategies, adaptive threshold optimization, or specialized sampling techniques, deep learning models naturally exploit dataset imbalance by defaulting to conservative majority-class predictions. The model essentially learns that "always predicting negative for rare classes" minimizes training loss given the imbalanced distribution, rather than learning discriminative pathological features.

This behavior represents a **fundamental failure mode** of standard weakly-supervised learning on imbalanced medical datasets and must be addressed in clinical deployment. The moderate overall AUC scores reflect this trade-off—the model achieves reasonable performance on common pathologies (Support Devices, Cardiomegaly) while completely failing on rare conditions.

**Grad-CAM Spatial Resolution Limitations:**

The broad, diffuse activation patterns observed in our Grad-CAM visualizations stem directly from two architectural constraints:

1. **Low Feature Map Resolution:** DenseNet-121's final convolutional layer produces 7×7 spatial feature maps (after global average pooling reduces spatial dimensions through successive downsampling). When upsampled to the original 224×224 image resolution, each of the 49 feature map locations corresponds to a 32×32 pixel receptive field—inherently limiting localization precision to coarse regions rather than pixel-level accuracy.

2. **Global Average Pooling:** The pooling operation before the classification layer explicitly discards spatial information, forcing the model to learn spatially-invariant features. While this improves classification robustness to object position, it fundamentally limits the model's ability to encode precise pathological locations.

**Mitigation Strategies for Future Work:** Extracting Grad-CAM from intermediate network layers with higher spatial resolution (e.g., the output of DenseBlock 2 or 3, which maintain 28×28 or 14×14 feature maps) could provide finer-grained localization while still leveraging high-level semantic features. Alternatively, architectures specifically designed for dense prediction tasks (e.g., U-Net, Feature Pyramid Networks) that maintain spatial resolution throughout the network could enable both accurate classification and precise localization.

**Weak Label Noise and Uncertainty:**

Our reliance on **weak labels** automatically extracted by the CheXpert NLP tool, while highly resource-efficient, introduces several sources of potential error:

- **NLP Extraction Errors:** The CheXpert labeler operates on free-text radiology reports, which may contain ambiguous language, negations, or uncertain findings. The automated extraction may misinterpret clinical context, leading to incorrect labels.

- **Report-Image Misalignment:** Radiology reports describe overall clinical impressions that may not be directly visible in the specific X-ray view provided. For example, a report mentioning pneumonia might be based on additional clinical context, lab results, or follow-up imaging not present in the single X-ray we use for training.

- **Uncertainty Labels:** The CheXpert labeler outputs uncertain labels (marked as -1) for mentions with qualified or ambiguous phrasing. Following the CheXpert convention, we map these to positive (1), which may introduce false positives for equivocal findings.

- **Missing Ground Truth for Validation:** Without pixel-level expert annotations or bounding boxes, we cannot rigorously quantify the actual accuracy of our weak labels. The true positive rate of the NLP-extracted labels remains unknown.

The cumulative effect of these weak label limitations likely contributes to the moderate model performance and may explain why the model learns broad, conservative features rather than precise pathological patterns.

**Generalization and External Validity Concerns:**

The model's generalization ability is constrained by several dataset-specific factors:

- **Single Institution Bias:** MIMIC-CXR originates from a single hospital system (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center), potentially encoding institution-specific imaging protocols, patient demographics, and disease prevalence patterns that may not transfer to other clinical settings.

- **Limited Patient Diversity:** With only 1,000 unique patients, the dataset may not adequately represent the full spectrum of pathological presentations, body habitus variations, image quality conditions, and comorbidity patterns encountered in diverse clinical practice.

- **Temporal Consistency:** All images originate from a specific time period, potentially missing evolving imaging technologies, updated clinical protocols, or emerging pathological patterns.

**Need for External Validation:** Rigorous external validation on independent datasets from different institutions, geographic regions, and patient populations is essential to establish the model's true generalization capacity and identify potential failure modes before clinical deployment.

**Transfer Learning Domain Gap:**

While ImageNet pretraining provides useful low-level feature detectors (edges, textures, shapes) and accelerates convergence, the domain gap between natural photographs and medical radiographs may limit ultimate performance:

- ImageNet features optimize for object recognition in natural scenes (animals, vehicles, everyday objects) with color information and complex textures
- Chest X-rays require specialized medical feature detectors (lung markings, anatomical boundaries, pathological opacities) in grayscale modality

**Alternative Pretraining Strategy:** Domain-specific pretraining on large-scale unlabeled chest X-ray collections (using self-supervised learning objectives like contrastive learning, masked image modeling, or rotation prediction) could provide more clinically relevant initialization weights and potentially improve diagnostic performance beyond ImageNet-based transfer learning.

**Lack of Prospective Clinical Validation:**

The current study is entirely retrospective, analyzing a fixed dataset collected and labeled prior to model development. Critical limitations of this approach include:

- **No Real-Time Performance Assessment:** We cannot evaluate how the model performs on newly acquired images with current imaging equipment and protocols
- **No Clinical Workflow Integration:** Unknown impact on radiologist efficiency, diagnostic accuracy in practice, or clinical decision-making
- **No User Acceptance Study:** Clinician trust, interpretability perception, and willingness to rely on AI assistance remain unmeasured
- **No Patient Outcome Tracking:** Whether AI-assisted diagnosis improves patient outcomes, reduces diagnostic errors, or affects treatment decisions is unknown

**Path to Clinical Translation:** Prospective clinical trials with real-time deployment, integrated workflow assessment, and patient outcome tracking are essential next steps before any clinical adoption can be considered. Such studies must include failure mode analysis, edge case detection, and comprehensive safety evaluation under realistic operating conditions.
